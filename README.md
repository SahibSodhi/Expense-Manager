Moneypoly is a simple expense app tracker that lets you add or edit an expense and shows the total of those tracked expenses.



## Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) for Windows
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for Mac



## Installing

1. Clone the repo

2. `cd` to project directory and `npm install` 

3. Open **Android Studio**, open an existing project, go to the project folder and under it select the **android** folder, click **ok**.

4. Run the App or `Shift+F10`

5. Under **Tools**, open AVD Manager and create your device simulator. My working simulator is **Nexus 5X Marshmallow 23(API level) Android 6.0 (Google APIs)**

6. Launch the new Android Virtual Device in the emulator by clicking the play button

7. Using **Windows Powershell**, `cd` to project folder and run `react-native run-android`. 

8. A metro bundler window should pop up and you should see a message that says 

   > Loading dependency graph, done.

## Built With

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - the Web Framework used

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - to manage the state of the whole app

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - for the database and user authentication



## App Status

This project was meant for me to learn React Native and to have a better understanding of React and Redux in general. I have achieved what I intended for this project and will not be working anymore with this repo. 

I plan to recreate this same app but with a different approach, and possibly more features.

This runs really slow using Android Studio and I can safely say that the Expo XDE is a lot better when is comes to development performance.
